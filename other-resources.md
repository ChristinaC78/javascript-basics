## JavaScript

[The JavaScript Way](https://github.com/bpesquet/thejsway) - 
A great introduction to JavaScript going over much of the same content that we convered in Part 1 of the book.

Parts 2 and 3 build on that knowledge to build a web server and web site using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) - 
A great tutorial on programming JavaScript well. It moves at a much faster pace then we did in class, but teaches very useful concepts and patterns to use while coding.

[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) - 
An in depth book series about JavaScript. The first 3 books are a deeper dive into topics that we covered in class including *scopes* and *objects*. These are a challenging read since they are meant to be comprehensive, not introductory knowledge.

## JavaScript, HTML, CSS, More

[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - 
A series of online hands-on lessons to teach you web development and programming.

[Spanish YouTube Development Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/codigofacilito/videos)
I can't speak up for the quality of this content, but hopefully it is useful.
