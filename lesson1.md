# Terminal Introduction

--

## Basic Commands

* `ls` - list directory contents
* `cd` - change directory
* `pwd` - print working directory

--

## How do I know what these programs can do

`man <command>`

e.g.

`man ls`

This opens a documentation manual for many command line programs

Use `q` to exit the manual page for the program

--

What does the `-l` parameter do for the `ls` program?

## Useful shortcuts

* Use the arrow up key to get the last command you typed
  * Continue pressing the up key to go to progressively earlier commands
* Clear the terminal with `Ctrl-k` or the `clear` program
* Tab completion
  * Most terminals support tab completion to help with things like typing path/file names
  * If you press tab after starting to type a filename, it will look for a matching filename and finish typing it if possible
* If you get stuck and don't know how to get back to a normal terminal window
  * `Ctrl-C` will cancel the running program
  * If all else fails close the terminal and open a new one
