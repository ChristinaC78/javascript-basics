## Abstraction
Hiding complexity by providing a simpler interface.

A common interface can be used to interact with systems that operate very differently internally.

Examples of abstraction:
* Steering wheel
* Video game controller
* Web browsers

## Algorithms
A process or set of rules to follow to solve a problem.

Examples of algorithms:
* Recipes
* Tying your shoes
* Driving to work/school
* Finding the longest string in an array
* Sorting an array of numbers

## Composition
Using simple pieces to create something complex.

Examples of composition:
* A symphony
* Legos

# Scope

Scope is the area within a program that a variable is accessible.

Methods create their own scope, and the code outside the method doesn't have access to the methods scope.

The parameters of a method are temporary. They cease to exist after we exit the method.

## Reference vs value

A *reference* is a pointer to a location in memory where a *value* is stored.

For the primitive types of *boolean*, *number*, *string*, *null*, and *undefined* JavaScript always stores the actual value in a variable.

For reference types, including *Objects*, JavaScript stores a *reference* to the object in a variable.

This leads to some very different behavior between the two types, and can be quite confusing when you are first learning JavaScript or any other language with similar behavior.
