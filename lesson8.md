# Abstraction

--

* Hiding complexity by providing a simpler interface
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* representing essential features without including the background details or explanations
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* removing physical, spatial, or temporal details
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

Examples of abstractions

* [Steering wheel](https://www.howacarworks.com/basics/how-the-steering-system-works)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Video game controller
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Web browser
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

Benefits of abstractions

* A common interface can be used to interact with systems that operate very differently internally

* Abstraction allows you to think about code at a higher level

---

# Algorithms

--

A process or set of rules to follow to solve a problem
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
An unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

Examples
* Recipes
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Tying your shoes
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Driving to work/school
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Finding the longest string in an array
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Sorting an array of numbers from smallest to largest
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

# Composition

--

Using simple pieces to create something complex  
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
The nature of something's ingredients or constituents  
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
the way in which a whole or mixture is made up  
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

--

Examples
* A symphony
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Legos
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
